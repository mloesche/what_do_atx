		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Foundation and Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 15,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down each infrastructure component (Next.js, Terraform for each GCP service, Docker, CI/CD, TailwindCSS, project structure, environment setup, documentation, rollback procedures) into granular, independently testable subtasks. Include subtasks for secrets management, environment variable configuration, and cross-service integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves initializing multiple foundational systems (frontend, backend, infrastructure, CI/CD, environments, documentation, rollback) and integrating them. The breadth of technologies, cross-cutting concerns, and the need for robust automation and documentation make it highly complex and warrant further decomposition for parallelization and risk mitigation.[1][2][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Google OAuth Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for OAuth credential setup, JWT logic, endpoint implementation, secure token storage, middleware, profile management, input validation, security review, testing, and documentation. Separate client and server responsibilities and include subtasks for error handling and edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication systems are security-critical and require careful handling of credentials, tokens, and user data. The integration of OAuth, JWT, encrypted storage, middleware, and profile management, along with security best practices and comprehensive testing, adds significant complexity.[1][3][4]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Event Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for schema design, extension setup (PostGIS, pgvector), index creation, migration tooling, sample data validation, and documentation. Include subtasks for schema review, performance benchmarking, and migration rollback procedures.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires advanced database design, spatial and vector extension integration, indexing for performance, and migration management. The need for normalization, extensibility, and performance optimization increases complexity, though it is more contained than full-stack or infrastructure tasks.[2][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Event Ingestion Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for each data source (scraper, API), normalization, deduplication, geocoding, queue setup, containerization, scheduling, error handling, retries, testing, and documentation. Include subtasks for monitoring, logging, and scaling considerations.",
			"reasoning": "The pipeline spans multiple technologies (scraping, APIs, data processing, cloud jobs, messaging, error handling) and must be robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant. Data normalization and deduplication add algorithmic complexity, and integration with cloud services increases operational overhead.[1][2][3]"

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Google Calendar Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for API/OAuth setup, token storage, refresh logic, calendar data retrieval, conflict detection, UI integration, error handling, and documentation. Separate backend and frontend responsibilities and include subtasks for permission management.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves secure OAuth integration, token lifecycle management, API data processing, conflict detection algorithms, and user interface work. Security and reliability requirements, along with cross-system integration, contribute to its moderate-to-high complexity.[1][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Event Listing UI and Basic Filtering",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for each UI component (cards, grid, filters, detail modal), responsive design, accessibility, PWA setup, E2E testing, and documentation. Include subtasks for state management, user interaction handling, and visual QA.",
			"reasoning": "While primarily frontend-focused, this task covers a wide range of UI/UX concerns (responsive design, accessibility, filtering, PWA), requiring careful attention to detail and user experience. Complexity is moderate due to the breadth of requirements and need for robust testing.[1][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Recommendation Engine with Vector Similarity",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for API setup, embedding integration, vector search, hybrid scoring, feedback learning, ranking, caching, user validation, testing, and documentation. Include subtasks for performance optimization and algorithm tuning.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines machine learning (embeddings, similarity), algorithm development (hybrid scoring, ranking), feedback loops, and performance optimization. The integration of multiple advanced components and the need for accuracy and scalability make it complex.[1][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Conversational AI Chat Interface",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for API integration, orchestrator service, function definition, chat UI, context management, deep-linking, natural language processing, testing, and documentation. Include subtasks for error handling and user experience refinement.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves advanced AI integration, backend orchestration, frontend chat UI, context management, and natural language understanding. The need for seamless user experience and robust function-calling increases both technical and design complexity.[1][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Add Ticket Purchase Integration and User Feedback System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for deep-link generation, UI feedback controls, feedback storage, recommendation integration, sharing features, affiliate tracking, testing, and documentation. Include subtasks for analytics and privacy compliance.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires integration of external links, user feedback mechanisms, and personalization logic. While less complex than core infrastructure or AI tasks, it involves multiple touchpoints and user interaction flows that require careful coordination.[1][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Monitoring, Analytics, and Admin Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for logging setup, metrics exporter, dashboard development, moderation tools, analytics, alerting, performance monitoring, integration with communication channels, and documentation. Include subtasks for security and access control.",
			"reasoning": "This task spans observability, admin tooling, analytics, and alerting across multiple services. The need for real-time monitoring, actionable dashboards, and robust alerting increases operational and technical complexity.[1][3]"
